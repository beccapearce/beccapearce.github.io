          i. Coder
        </div>
        <div id="description1">
          <p>After attending a couple of pitch decks, I saw the wide spread effect code could have, and, after always enjoying a good logic puzzle I decided to embark on a 12 week coding bootcamp. Now I have completed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a></li>, I have seriously bulked up my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/beccapearce">Github</a></li> (go on take a peek!). </p>
          <p> Ruby is by far my strongest language with Rails and Sinatra frameworks, I also have an understanding of Javascript (with Node) and Elixir (with Phoenix). Currently I am also learning Python and Clojure. </p>
          <p>My interests in code include software craftsmanship and best practices and Machine Learning, especially in Natural Language Processing.</p>

          ii. Teacher
        </div>
        <div id="description2">
          <p>After University, I took up teaching both English as a foriegn language and Latin. I thoroughly enjoyed teaching from working with young children to adults and found it a extremely rewarding experience.</p>
          <p>From teaching I improved my communication skills and my ability to take large issues and break them down into simple more managable chunks, I also learned A LOT of cheesy and catchy children's songs.</p>

          iii. Volunteer
        </div>
        <div id="description3">
          <p>I really enjoy voluntary work and putting any useful skills I have to good use. I started with a few voluntary projects while I was in university, until I starteed volunteering at The Latin Programme. This project stuck with me and I continued to volunteer there until I was offered a position to work there</p>
          <p>Another project I have been invovled in is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hcpt.org.uk/">HCPT</a> (Group 42), a charity that works to give children and young people with disabilities from disadvantaged backgrounds a week long holiday in France. This role includes a vast amount of admin work outside the week itself from risk assessments to home visits.</p>
          <p>In HCPT Group 42, I have started taking on more positions of responsibility, last year being the groups spritual leader and this year taking on the lead admin position.</p>
